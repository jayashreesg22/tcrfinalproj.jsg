        <div id="aboutus">
            <p>____The online food ordering market has increased in the U.S with 40 percent of U.S adults
                having ordered their food online once.[3] The online food ordering market includes foods
                prepared by restaurants, prepared by independent people, and groceries being ordered online
                and then picked up or delivered.[4][5][6]
                The first online food ordering service, World Wide Waiter (now known as Waiter.com), <br>
                was founded in 1995.[7] The site originally serviced only northern California, later
                expanding to several additional cities in the United States.[8]

                By the late 2000s, major pizza chains had created their own mobile applications and started doing 20–30
                percent of their business online.[9] With increased smartphone penetration, and the growth of both Uber
                and the sharing economy, food delivery startups started to receive more attention.<br> <br>____In 2010,
                Snapfinger, who is a
                multi-restaurant ordering website, had a growth in their mobile food orders by 17 percent in one
                year.[3]
                By 2015, online ordering began overtaking phone ordering.[10]<br>
                In 2015, China's online food ordering and delivery market grew from 0.15 billion yuan to 44.25 billion
                yuan.[11]<br>
                As of September 2016, online delivery accounted for about 3 percent of the 61 billion U.S. restaurant
                transactions.[12]
